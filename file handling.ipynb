In this lecture, we will learn the basics of 1-D tensors \\r\\n\\r\\nsuch as Types, Indexing and Slicing, Basic Operations, Universal Functions\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start by understanding what a 1 D tensor is \\r\\n\\r\\nA 0-d tensor is just a number, \\r\\n\\r\\n1-D tensor is an array of numbers. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be: A row in a data database, A vector, Time series\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA tensor contains elements of a single data type. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe tensor type is the type of tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we are dealing with real numbers, the tensor type could either be a float tensor or a double tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we are dealing with unsigned integers that are used in 8 bit images, the tensor type is a byte tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we see we have a variety of different tensor types depending upon the data type of the elements in the tensor \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can create a tensor in the following manner: \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we import torch. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext, we create a python list with the following elements 7,4,3,2,6. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe then cast this list to a pytorch tensor using the constructor for tensors. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that simple to create a tensor in pytorch We can access the data via an index in the tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs with a lists, we can access each element with an integer and a square bracket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can use the data attribute dtype to find the type of data that is stored within the tensor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can use the method type to find the type of the tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nconsidr a  example, we create a float tensor, as the elements in the list are floats. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can use the data attribute dtype to find the type of data that is stored within the Tensor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can use the method type to find the type of the tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also specify the datatype of a tensor with the constructor. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can specify the data type using the parameter d type Even though the list contains floats, the dtype of the tensor is int 32. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also explicitly create a tensor of a specific type, \\r\\n\\r\\nconsider a example we create a float tensor explicitly using the FloatTensor method \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s check the type of tensor. We see the type of the tensor is a float tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we print out a, we can see the decimals were added to the numbers in the tensor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also change the type of the tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the following tensor of long type. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can convert the type of the tensor to float using the (type) method, passing in the argument(torch.FloatTensor) We can verify the type of the tensor has changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can cast the following list to a tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe method size gives us the number of elements in the tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs there a 5 elements the result is 5. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe attribute \\xe2\\x80\\x9cndimension\\xe2\\x80\\x9d represents the number of dimensions or the rank of the tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case rank of the tensor is one\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many cases, you will require 2-D tensors as inputs to your neural networks. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere we have a pytorch tensor with 5 elements in it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe dimension of this tensor is 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will convert this tensor into a 2-D tensor using the view method in pytorch  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first argument of the view method represents the number of rows in this case 5 and the second element represents the number of columns, in this case, 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we didn't know that the original tensor had 5 elements in it, \\r\\n\\r\\nwe could use a value of -1 for the first argument and pytorch will infer the number of rows in the new tensor for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we now check the dimension of the a_col tensor using the ndimension method in pytorch, we will see it has a dimension of 2 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nconsider a  example, the tensor has 6 elements in it \\r\\n\\r\\nas before we can reshape the tensor using the view method, \\r\\n\\r\\nas there is 6 elements in the original tensor, we pass 6 as the first argument to the view method for creating 6 rows \\r\\n\\r\\nand 1 as the second argument to create one column. \\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, we could have used a -1 instead of 6 for the first argument for the view mwthod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not difficult to convert PyTorch tensors to numpy arrays and Python lists and then convert them back. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis gives PyTorch the ability to work within the python ecosystem Many Python libraries use numpy arrays. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the following numpy array  we can convert a numpy array to a torch tensor using the function \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom numpy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nwe can convert the torch tensor back to numpy array using the method numpy \\r\\n\\r\\nlet's represent numpy_array with the blue box \\r\\n\\r\\nand the torch tensor with a red box \\r\\n\\r\\nand back_to_numpy with a green box \\r\\n\\r\\nback_to_numpy points to the variable torch_tensor \\r\\n\\r\\nthe variable torch_tensor points to the variable numpy_array , \\r\\n\\r\\ntherefore if you change the variable numpy_array both torch_tensor and back_to_numpy will change. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will see an example of this in the lab Many Python libraries use numpy arrays. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the following bumpy array. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can convert a numpy array to a torch tensor using the function \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom numpy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can convert the torch tensor back to numpy array using the method numpy Let's represent numpy_array with the blue box and the torch tensor with a red box. \\r\\n\\r\\nand back_to_numpy with a green box. \\r\\n\\r\\nBack_to_numpy points to the variable torch_tensor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe variable torch_tensor points to the variable numpy_array, \\r\\n\\r\\ntherefore if you change the variable numpy_array both torch_tensor and back_to_numpy will change. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will see an example of this in the lab.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n"
